### How to Play ###
Pick a square and type a number (1-9) using the number row on your keyboard
The number should appear only once in the row, column and square or "sub-grid" (9 spaces each)
If you sure of your answer, hit the Enter key
if a red 'X' appears on the top right of the window screen, you are incorrect and have to try again
If you are stuck and not sure what to do, press the 'Hint' button, but beware that you only have 3 hints
If you entered 5 wrong answers, you lose the game. Please try again!
